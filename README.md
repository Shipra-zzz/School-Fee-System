Fee Management

This project is made for solving a problem faced by a school situated in a village. Most of the fee payment there comes in the form of cash.
The management wants a friendly interface where the cashiers can add the cash amount in each students account using a user-friendly GUI.
Additionally, the principal and the manager have rights to waive off fee of some students.

This website has different account types for managers, cashiers and students.

Managers - The prime users having the ability to add cashiers and students, view the records of each student, waive off fee of students
Cahiers - These users can add the records of fee payment, add students and view their records.
Students - They can view the fee that has been submitted or waived off
